# This directory should contain notification.mp3
# Since we cannot create actual audio files, the hook includes a Web Audio API fallback
# 
# To add the actual sound file:
# 1. Find a pleasant notification sound (1-3 seconds)
# 2. Convert to MP3 format
# 3. Save as notification.mp3 in this directory
#
# The Web Audio fallback will generate a simple beep tone if the MP3 file is not found
